Neighborhood Map Project
=================================

Here is a web application that shows some of the places worth visiting around a particular location like Hong Kong, for example.

To run, open index.html on your browser.

We start with a number of key locations that the user can select.

* **On a mobile or small-width device**:
Click on the menu button to display a search field and list of places. Start entering text in the search field will filter the list. Click on a list item or marker to show more information on the location.

* **On a tablet**:
  The search field and list of places will appear at the top of the page. Start entering text in the search field will filter the list of places. Click on a list item or marker to show more information on the location.

* **On a PC or wide-screen device**:
  The search field and list of places will appear on the left side of the page. Start entering text in the search field will filter the list of places. Click on a list item or marker to show more information on the location.


Choosing a place in the list or on a marker on the map will center the map on the marker and open its infowindow.

Infowindow contains information from calls to *Wikipedia* and *NY Times* APIs.

Clearing all text in the search field will restore all original markers on the map and the list of places.
