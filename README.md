Neighborhood Map Project
=================================

Here is a web application that shows some of the places worth visiting around a particular location like Hong Kong, for example.

We start out with a number of key locations that the user can select using the list menu, or using the input field to filter.

When the user clicks on a place in the list menu or on a marker on the map, the map will center on the marker and open its infowindow.

Infowindow contains result of calls to Wikipedia API and NY Times API.
